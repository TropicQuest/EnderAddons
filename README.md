# Future plans for v2: The Enderbiome update
* New forest biome in end, will have navy blue wood and trees and shouldnt be too rare.
* Biome exclusive mob, endercreeper will function like a normal creeper but do more damage + drop speical ingredent for making the armored elytra
* Also endercows, which will drop steak that will function like a chorus friut when uncooked but be like a cooked steak, when cooked becomes super good food item 1.5x better than steak.
* New grass for biome that will look cool.
* Ender elytra, will function as diamond or netherite chestplate + elytra, whichever I decide.
* Advancements

Note: these plans are really ambitious for a first mod, so they may take a while but I will figure them out.
